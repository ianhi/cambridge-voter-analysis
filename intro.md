# Introduction


This website contains analysis of who voted in every Cambridge election since 2011.

Some key takeaways:
 - There has been a large increase in participation in local election by voters under 40 since 2016
 - Even year (National + State) elections drive significantly higher turnout
    - This effect is amplified in under 40 voters.
 - Undergraduates have extremely low registration and turnout. Especially in local elections.
